Exercise 11.1:
	c. The J2SE is the JDK and J2EE is the server side (JDK and GlassFish)
	d. The application gives .jsp code which runs at the web tier. 
	e. GlassFish runs a javax.servlet, which serves up the .jsp web page
	f. A WAR file is just a JAR file for the web. 
	g. An exploded WAR file is just the extracted WAR file that is ready for deployment to a web server
	h. EAR contains all of the project compnents, not just the servlets and jsps. EAR is a much bigger artifact and is more for the whole entire project, not just one jsp
	
Exercise 11.2:
	The application uses JAX-RS to create the REST endpoints and JAXB to serialize/deserialize classes
