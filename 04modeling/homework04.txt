4.1:
	a. The Book table is in 1NF because there are no sets or tuples. It is not in BCNF because a non-key attribute (b_type) F.D.s another non-key attribute (list_price)

	b.
		 1) Book (b_title, b_type, publisher, list_price)
			 Author(a_name, a_affil)

	This normalization step separates the FDs that are primary keys into different tables. The database is now in 3NF

		 2) Book(b_title, b_type, publisher)
			  BookPrice(b_type, list_price)
			  Author(a_name, a_affil)

	This normalization step removes the prime attribute from the Book table, giving the b_type -> list_price tuple its own table

4.2:
	a. 
		{Author, Edition} and all permutations containing the two attributes are the candidate keys

	b. 
		{Book} ->> {Author}| {Edition, Year}

	Given edition and year, the authors Navathe and Elmosa have the same Book_Name (DB_Fun). Here we can see that Book_Name determines a finite list of Authors for each Book_Name. This indeed signals a multivalue dep.

	c. 
		Book(Book_id, Book_Name, Author)
		BookEditionYear(Book_id, Edition, Year)
		
	This normalization eliminates any multi-value dependencies. The dependencies are now:
		Book_id -> Book_Name, Author
		Book_id -> Edition, Year

	This form is now in 4NF because all of the attributes on the left hand side are superkeys and there are no more multi-value dependencies. Best of all, the relations are still perserved.
