Lab 13:
	Exercise 13.1:
		a. em.persist() creates a new entry, but does not update a new entry, while the store.put() can both update and create entries. Also, the em performs the operation on the object stored in the entity manager, not on the database itself.
		
		b. the store.put() operates on directly to the database compared to myHashTable.put() which just makes edits on the object itself
		
	Exercise 13.2:
		a. Both relational and kvlite keys both are unique keys of which to access a record from. 
		
	Exercise 13.3:
		a. The one table would have a key-value that has a foreign key of a record in the many table. You would access the one table and then use that foreign key to access the many table.
		
		b. The empty value may be used as a get all store of construct.
